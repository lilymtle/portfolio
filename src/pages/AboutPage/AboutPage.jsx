                As a former nurse transitioning to software engineering, I bring a unique 
                perspective to tech development. My nursing experience has shaped my understanding
                of user needs, allowing me to create empathetic, efficient software solutions.
                I also honed my ability to communicate effectively, manage high-stress situations,
                and think criticallyâ€”skills that seamlessly translate to software development.
