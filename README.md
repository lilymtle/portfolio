    <p>Okay, making some progress! I started working on the page that will display all the posts. Got a few card placeholders up to work on the layout and also played around with what the cards for blog posts will consist of. Added a "Sort by" dropdown and will add functionality into it later. Need to work on the Resources and Error page. Hoping this weekend I can learn more about Sanity and publish my first post. Once that's done, I'll have to go back and refactor code where I can. Almost done! Cannot wait to share it. üòÅ</p>

    <p>Great news! I finished applying the tablet and desktop breakpoints for the header and footer. I also finished making my FAQs and About page. Made them responsive as well. ü•π Going to work on the Contact and Learning pages later. Oh, I decided on Sanity will be my headless CMS of choice!</p>

    <p>I finally settled on a design, but it's pretty much similar to my portfolio. I love having a huge hero that takes up the entire viewport. ü´£ But I'll try to make my blog a bit more different from my portfolio. Finished the navigation menu, hero, and footer. Now... I will have to learn about headless CMS!

    <p>After several months of contemplating, I decided to add a blog to my portfolio. I have added the route to the app and been brainstorming on the design. I also did some work on the logo/hero and footer but... I think I'll go with a different design. üòÖ I am starting to feel web design with good UX/UI is more difficult than writing code. Kudos to all the designers out there!
